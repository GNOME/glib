If you want to hack on the GLib project, you'll need to have the
following packages installed:

        - Meson 0.48.0
        - GNU gettext 0.10.40
        - pkg-config 0.16
        - gtk-doc
        - libffi 3.0.0

To compile a Git version of glib on your system, you will need to take
several steps to setup the tree for compilation.  You can do all these
steps at once by running:

        checkout/glib# meson _build

For information about submitting patches see the CONTRIBUTING.md file. For
information about major design decisions, see the README.rationale file.
