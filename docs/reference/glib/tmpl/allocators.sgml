deprecated way to allocate chunks of memory for GList, GSList and GNode

<para>
Prior to 2.10, #GAllocator was used as an efficient way to allocate 
small pieces of memory for use with the #GList, #GSList and #GNode data 
structures. Since 2.10, it has been completely replaced by the 
<link linkend="glib-Memory-Slices">slice allocator</link> and deprecated.

<!-- ##### STRUCT GAllocator ##### -->
<para>
The <structname>GAllocator</structname> struct contains private data. and 
should only be accessed using the following functions.
</para>


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_allocator_new ##### -->
<para>
Creates a new #GAllocator.
</para>

@name: the name of the #GAllocator. This name is used to set the name of the
#GMemChunk used by the #GAllocator, and is only used for debugging.
@n_preallocs: the number of elements in each block of memory allocated.
Larger blocks mean less calls to g_malloc(), but some memory may be wasted.
(GLib uses 128 elements per block by default.) The value must be between 1
and 65535.
@Returns: a new #GAllocator.
@Deprecated: 2.10: Use the <link linkend="glib-Memory-Slices">slice allocator</link>
instead


<!-- ##### FUNCTION g_allocator_free ##### -->
<para>
Frees all of the memory allocated by the #GAllocator.
</para>

@allocator: a #GAllocator.
@Deprecated: 2.10: Use the <link linkend="glib-Memory-Slices">slice allocator</link>
instead
