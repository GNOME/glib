    <title>GObject: what brings everything together.</title>

    <para>
      The two previous chapters discussed the details of Glib's Dynamic Type System
      and its signal control system. The GObject library also contains an implementation
      for a base fundamental type named <type>GObject</type>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <type>GObject</type> is a fundamental classed instantiable type. It implements:

	<listitem><para>Generic per-object properties with set/get function pairs</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Easy use of signals</para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      All the GTK+ objects and all of the objects in Gnome libraries which use the glib type
      system inherit from <type>GObject</type> which is why it is important to understand
      the details of how it works.

      <para>
	The <function>g_object_new</function> family of functions can be used to instantiate any
	GType which inherits from the GObject base type. All these functions make sure the class
	has been correctly initialized by glib's type system and then invoke at one
	point or another the constructor class method which is used to:
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>
	      Allocate memory through <function>g_type_create_instance</function>,
	    </para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>
	      Initialize the object' instance with the construction properties.
	    </para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
      </para>

      <para>
	Objects which inherit from GObject are allowed to override this constructor class method:
	they should however chain to their parent constructor method before doing so:
<programlisting>
  GObject*   (*constructor)     (GType                  type,
                                 guint                  n_construct_properties,

	If the user instantiates an object <type>MamanBar</type> with:
<programlisting>
MamanBar *bar = g_object_new (MAMAN_TYPE_BAR, NULL);
</programlisting>	
	If this is the first instantiation of such an object, the <function>maman_b_class_init</function>
	function will be invoked after any <function>maman_b_base_class_init</function> function. 
	This will make sure the class structure of this new object is correctly initialized. Here, 
	<function>maman_bar_class_init</function> is expected to override the object's class methods
	and setup the class' own methods. In the example above, the constructor method is the only 
	overridden method: it is set to <function>maman_bar_constructor</function>.
      </para>

      <para>
	Once <function>g_object_new</function> has obtained a reference to an initialized
	class structure, it invokes its constructor method to create an instance of the new 
	object. Since it has just been overridden by <function>maman_bar_class_init</function> 
	to <function>maman_bar_constructor</function>, the latter is called and, because it
	was implemented correctly, it chains up to its parent's constructor. The problem here
	is how we can find the parent constructor. An approach (used in GTK+ source code) would be
	to save the original constructor in a static variable from <function>maman_bar_class_init</function>
	and then to re-use it from <function>maman_bar_constructor</function>. This is clearly possible
	and very simple but I was told it was not nice and the prefered way is to use the 
	<function>g_type_class_peek</function> and <function>g_type_class_peek_parent</function> functions.
      </para>

      <para>
	Finally, at one point or another, <function>g_object_constructor</function> is invoked
	by the last constructor in the chain. This function allocates the object's instance' buffer 
	through <function>g_type_create_instance</function>
	which means that the instance_init function is invoked at this point if one
	was registered. After instance_init returns, the object is fully initialized and should be 
	ready to answer any user-request. When <function>g_type_create_instance</function>
	returns, <function>g_object_constructor</function> sets the construction properties
	(ie: the properties which were given to <function>g_object_new</function>) and returns
	to the user's constructor which is then allowed to do useful instance initialization...
      </para>

      <para>
	The process described above might seem a bit complicated (it <emphasis>is</emphasis> actually
	overly complicated in my opinion..) but it can be summarized easily by the table below which
	lists the functions invoked by <function>g_object_new</function> and their order of

	Weak References are used to monitor object finalization: 
	<function>g_object_weak_ref</function> adds a monitoring callback which does
	not hold a reference to the object but which is invoked when the object runs

	and <function>g_object_remove_weak_pointer</function>. These functions add a weak reference

      <title>Reference counts and cycles</title>
      
      <para>
	Note: the following section was inspired by James Henstridge. I guess this means that 
	all praise and all curses will be directly forwarded to him.
      </para>

      <para>
	GObject's memory management model was designed to be easily integrated in existing code
	using garbage collection. This is why the destruction process is split in two phases:
	the first phase, executed in the dispose handler is supposed to release all references
	to other member objects. The second phase, executed by the finalize handler is supposed
	to complete the object's destruction process. Object methods should be able to run
	without program error (that is, without segfault :) in-between the two phases.
      </para>

      <para>
	This two-step destruction process is very useful to break reference counting cycles.
	While the detection of the cycles is up to the external code, once the cycles have been
	detected, the external code can invoke <function>g_object_dispose</function> which 
	will indeed break any existing cycles since it will run the dispose handler associated
	to the object and thus release all references to other objects.
      </para>

      <para>
	Attentive readers might now have understood one of the rules about the dispose handler
	we stated a bit sooner: the dispose handler can be invoked multiple times. Let's say we
	have a reference count cycle: object A references B which itself references object A.
	Let's say we have detected the cycle and we want to destroy the two objects. One way to 
	do this would be to invoke <function>g_object_dispose</function> on one of the 
	objects.
      </para>

      <para>
	If object A releases all its references to all objects, this means it releases its
	reference to object B. If object B was not owned by anyone else, this is its last
	reference count which means this last unref runs B's dispose handler which, in turn,
	releases B's reference on object A. If this is A's last reference count, this last 
	unref runs A's dispose handler which is running for the second time before
	A's finalize handler is invoked !
      </para>

      <para>
	The above example, which might seem a bit contrived can really happen if your
	GObject's are being by language bindings. I would thus suggest the rules stated above
	for object destruction are closely followed. Otherwise, <emphasis>Bad Bad Things</emphasis> 
	will happen.

  <sect1 id="gobject-properties">
    <title>Object properties</title>

    <para>
      One of GObject's nice features is its generic get/set mechanism for object
      properties. When an object
      is instanciated, the object's class_init handler should be used to register
      the object's properties with <function>g_object_class_install_property</function>
      (implemented in <filename>gobject.c</filename>).

      The best way to understand how object properties work is by looking at a real example

      The client code just above looks simple but a lot of things happen under the hood:
    </para>

    <para>
      <function>g_object_set_property</function> first ensures a property
      with this name was registered in bar's class_init handler. If so, it calls
      <function>object_set_property</function> which first walks the class hierarchy,
      from bottom, most derived type, to top, fundamental type to find the class
      which registered that property. It then tries to convert the user-provided GValue
      into a GValue whose type if that of the associated property.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the user provides a signed char GValue, as is shown
      here, and if the object's property was registered as an unsigned int, 
      <function>g_value_transform</function> will try to transform the input signed char into
      an unsigned int. Of course, the success of the transformation depends on the availability
      of the required transform function. In practice, there will almost always be a transformation
        <footnote>
	  <para>Its behaviour might not be what you expect but it is up to you to actually avoid
      relying on these transformations.
	  </para>
        </footnote>
      which matches and conversion will be caried out if needed.
    </para>

    <para>
      After transformation, the <type>GValue</type> is validated by 
      <function>g_param_value_validate</function> which makes sure the user's
      data stored in the <type>GValue</type> matches the characteristics specified by
      the property's <type>GParamSpec</type>.  Here, the <type>GParamSpec</type> we 
      provided in class_init has a validation function which makes sure that the GValue
      contains a value which respects the minimum and maximum bounds of the 
      <type>GParamSpec</type>. In the example above, the client's GValue does not
      respect these constraints (it is set to 11, while the maximum is 10). As such, the
      <function>g_object_set_property</function> function will return with an error.
    </para>

    <para>
      If the user's GValue had been set to a valid value, <function>object_set_property</function>
      would have proceeded with calling the object's set_property class method. Here, since our
      implementation of Foo did override this method, the code path would jump to
      <function>foo_set_property</function> after having retrieved from the 
      <type>GParamSpec</type> the <emphasis>param_id</emphasis>
      <footnote>
	<para>
	  It should be noted that the param_id used here need only to uniquely identify each 
	  <type>GParamSpec</type> within the <type>FooClass</type> such that the switch
	  used in the set and get methods actually works. Of course, this locally-unique 
	  integer is purely an optimization: it would have been possible to use a set of 
	  <emphasis>if (strcmp (a, b) == 0) {} else if (strcmp (a, b) == 0) {}</emphasis> statements.
	</para>
      </footnote>
      which had been stored by
      <function>g_object_class_install_property</function>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Once the property has been set by the object's set_property class method, the code path
      returns to <function>g_object_set_property</function> which calls 
	<function>g_object_notify_queue_thaw</function>. This function makes sure that
	the "notify" signal is emitted on the object's instance with the changed property as
	parameter unless notifications were frozen by <function>g_object_freeze_notify</function>.
    </para>

    <para>
      <function>g_object_thaw_notify</function> can be used to re-enable notification of 
      property modifications through the "notify" signal. It is important to remember that
      even if properties are changed while property change notification is frozen, the "notify"
      signal will be emitted once for each of these changed properties as soon as the property
      change notification is thawn: no property change is lost for the "notify" signal. Signal
      can only be delayed by the notification freezing mechanism.
    </para>

        <title>Accessing multiple properties at once</title>


    <para>
      It is interesting to note that the <function>g_object_set</function> and 
      <function>g_object_set_valist</function> (vararg version) functions can be used to set
      multiple properties at once. The client code shown above can then be re-written as:
<programlisting>
MamanBar *foo;
foo = /* */;
g_object_set (G_OBJECT (foo),
              "papa-number", 2, 
              "maman-name", "test", 
              NULL);
</programlisting>
      The code above will trigger one notify signal emission for each property modified.
    </para>

    <para>
      Of course, the _get versions are also available: <function>g_object_get</function>
      and <function>g_object_get_valist</function> (vararg version) can be used to get numerous
      properties at once.
    </para>

    <para>
      Really attentive readers now understand how <function>g_object_new</function>,
      <function>g_object_newv</function> and <function>g_object_new_valist</function> 
      work: they parse the user-provided variable number of parameters and invoke
	<function>g_object_set</function> on each pair of parameters only after the object has been successfully constructed.
      Of course, the "notify" signal will be emitted for each property set.
