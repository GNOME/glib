	imply that this does more work than what it does, but its really only
	a name match (from #517086)
	
        * gdummyfile.c:
        * glocalfile.c:
        * tests/g-file.c:
	Update to match the above change.

	* gfile.c: (g_file_mount_mountable), (g_file_unmount_mountable),
	(g_file_eject_mountable):
	even more cases of not returning in error path

2008-02-20  Benjamin Otte  <otte@gnome.org>

	* gfile.c: (g_file_mount_mountable): 
	return from function in error path.

2008-02-18  Sylvain Pasche <sylvain.pasche@gmail.com>

        * gfile.h:

        * glocalfile.c:
        * glocalfileinfo.c:

2008-02-14  Alexander Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

        * glocalfile.c:
	Copy permissions with file on copy (#514084)
	This is what cp does and makes sure e.g. the
	exec permissions are kept.
	Its kinda weird in that it keeps the permission bits
	the same while the uid and gid are different. However
	the new uid is the user so its not a security issue,
	and I've heard no complaints about cp on this issue.

2008-02-13  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

        * gmount.[ch]:
        * gvolume.[ch]:
	Added GMountMountFlags enum and added a flags
	argument to all mount calls.
	
	This is an API/ABI change for future extensibility,
	as I think we will need at least an
	inhibit-autorun flag (the panel needs this).
	There are no flags defined yet though.

2008-02-11  Alexander Larsson  <alexl@redhat.com>

	* gfileinfo.h:

	Rework how volumes, drives and volume monitoring is
	done. Previosly the model was

	 GDrive <1-1> GVolume

	where a GDrive instance represented a mount point and a GVolume
	instance represented a mounted file system. This patch changes it
	the model to

		GDrive <1-N> GVolume <1-1> GMount

	where GMount now serves the purpose of the old GVolume and the new
	GVolume serves the purpose of the old GDrive. In addition the new
	GDrive interface is used to represent a collection of GVolume
	instances (typically partitions) and also contains utility to query
	the state of the physical drive the GDrive object represents (such
	as checking for media, polling the drive, ejecting the media etc.).

	Also implement mounting and unmounting in the Unix volume monitor
	backend. A subquent patch will introduce GDrive support for ejection
	of media.

	* gio/glocalfilemonitor.c:
	* gio/gunionvolumemonitor.c:
	Don't use g_once_init_*() for initializations that could fail and
	could leave the initialization variable set to 0 but use GOnce.
	This prevents a deadlock on the second call when trying to create
	a monitor and no monitor type is available. Thanks to Sven Herzberg
	for reporting.

2007-11-11  Sven Herzberg  <sven@imendio.com>

	Convert a g_return_val_if_fail() to setting the GError instead as
	otherwise applications have to verify the parameter before otherwise
	and the parameter might come directly from the user.

	Don't call monitor_file on the default interface vtable (which
