/**
 * SECTION:gthreadedsocketservice
 * @title: GThreadedSocketService
 * @short_description: A threaded GSocketService
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GSocketService.
 *
 * A #GThreadedSocketService is a simple subclass of #GSocketService
 * that handles incoming connections by creating a worker thread and
 * dispatching the connection to it by emitting the
 * #GThreadedSocketService::run signal in the new thread.
 *
 * The signal handler may perform blocking IO and need not return
 * until the connection is closed.
 *
 * The service is implemented using a thread pool, so there is a
 * limited amount of threads available to serve incoming requests.
 * The service automatically stops the #GSocketService from accepting
 * new connections when all threads are busy.
 *
 * As with #GSocketService, you may connect to #GThreadedSocketService::run,
 * or subclass and override the default handler.
