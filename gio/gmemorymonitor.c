/**

 * @title: GMemoryMonitor
 * @short_description: Memory usage monitor
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #GMemoryMonitor will monitor system memory and suggest to the application
 * when to free memory so as to leave more room for other applications.
 * It is implemented on Linux using the [Low Memory Monitor](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/hadess/low-memory-monitor/)
 * ([API documentation](https://hadess.pages.freedesktop.org/low-memory-monitor/)).
 *
 * There is also an implementation for use inside Flatpak sandboxes.
 *
 * Possible actions to take when the signal is received are:
 *
 *  - Free caches
 *  - Save files that haven't been looked at in a while to disk, ready to be reopened when needed
 *  - Run a garbage collection cycle
 *  - Try and compress fragmented allocations
 *  - Exit on idle if the process has no reason to stay around
 *  - Call [`malloc_trim(3)`](man:malloc_trim) to return cached heap pages to
 *    the kernel (if supported by your libc)
 *
 * Note that some actions may not always improve system performance, and so
 * should be profiled for your application. `malloc_trim()`, for example, may
 * make future heap allocations slower (due to releasing cached heap pages back
 * to the kernel).
 *
 * See #GMemoryMonitorWarningLevel for details on the various warning levels.
