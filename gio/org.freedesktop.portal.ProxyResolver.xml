      org.freedesktop.portal.ProxyResolver:
      @short_description: Proxy information

      The ProxyResolver interface provides network proxy information to sandboxed
      applications. It is not a portal in the strict sense, since it does not involve
      user interaction. Applications are expected to use this interface indirectly,
      via a library API such as the GLib GProxyResolver interface.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.

        Lookup:
        @uri: Destination to connect to
        @proxies: List of proxy uris

        Looks up which proxy to use to connect to @uri. The returned
        proxy uri are of the form 'protocol://[user[:password]@host:port'.
        The protocol can be http, rtsp, socks or another proxying protocol.
        'direct://' is used when no proxy is needed.
