General Information
===================

This is GLib version 2.4.1. GLib is the low-level core
library that forms the basis for projects such as GTK+ and GNOME. It
provides data structure handling for C, portability wrappers, and
interfaces for such runtime functionality as an event loop, threads,
dynamic loading, and an object system.

Installation

See the file 'INSTALL'

Notes about GLib-2.4.0
======================

* GObject now enforces CONSTRUCT_ONLY properties; due to an oversight
  in previous versions, it was possible to set CONSTRUCT_ONLY properties
  after construct time.

* The child watch functionality tends to reveal a bug in many
  thread implementations (in particular the older LinuxThreads implementation
  on Linux) where it's not possible to call waitpid() for a child
  created in a different thread. For this reason, for maximum portability,
  you should structure your code to fork all child processes that you want
  to wait for from the main thread.

* A problem was recently discovered with g_signal_connect_object(); 
  it doesn't actually disconnect the signal handler once the object being 
  connected to dies, just disables it. See the API docs for the function 
  for further details and the correct workaround that will continue to 
  work with future versions of GLib.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system. 
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product glib.) You will need
to create an account for yourself.

In the bug report please include:

* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built 
  in the gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. 
  As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece 
  of software that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out
  when the crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but
  is not necessary.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the
patch fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment
to that bug report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch,
and attach the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword
in their keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GLib 
programming interface, the API keyword should also be included.

Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU
diff.)
